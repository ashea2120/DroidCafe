## Issues and Lessons
 
A short description about the issues that you faced and the lessons that you learned.
- Learned how to add images to the project the "right way" 
  * Closing the project and adding the images to the drawable folder
- Learned how to make images essentially behave like buttons and display Toast messages when they're clicked
- Learned how to change the floating action button's icon and even changed the behavior of it
  * In the CodeLabs, the code they tell you to do (a separate onClick method), it looks like now it's just a onClickListener in the onCreate method in the MainActivity
- Learned and implemented radio buttons and a RadioGroup in the XML for the delivery choices in the OrderActivity activity
- Learned about and implemented a Spinner for user choices on the OrderActivity and how use different keyboards for the inputdata type 
- Learned how to add items to an options menu, add icons to those menu items, and even learned how to start an Activity from the menu items 
  * ie. Setup the Shopping cart menu item to take the user to the OrderActivity and if they've selected ice cream, froyo, or a donut, their order will show on the OrderActivity
- Instead of making an example project for the section of using DialogAlerts, I just added an AlertDialog to the Status menu item
- Learned how to add an upper navigation button to communicate between activities
